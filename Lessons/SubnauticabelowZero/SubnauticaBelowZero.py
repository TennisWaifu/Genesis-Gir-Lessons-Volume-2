Subnautica: BELOW ZERO is a program that takes the user into a thrilling survival horror experience that leaves 
them want to discover the oceans mysterious and depths, fight the blizzard and the cold and try to stay alive
the blistering heat of the changing seasons and find items and supplies to keep your hunger and food in check
gigantic creatures from out of this world! being stranded on an uncharted planet brings rewards but danger fight
the opposition. Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the
Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds. Submerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an
arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to 
investigate what happened to your sister...Alterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research 
stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and data banks scattered 
among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own. 
Survive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast
across the snowy tundra on a Snow fox hover bike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Sea truck.

𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝 𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙣 𝙡𝙞𝙛𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢𝙨
Something undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Hole fish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan,
and visit the adorable Peng wings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.

Variables are useful in the sense you can store data types & values within them to use in your program later on,
variables and constants have their differences in a way. variables values change throughout a program and constants
never change their values of the entire instance of a program! you make variables/constants with assignment
statements refer to the examples below to learn how to make them.

eg. rusty_crate = "plasma rifle"

the statement above is an assignment statement and consists of a variable/constant name, an assignment operator,
and the value that you wish to store inside its contents. use them , manipulate them, harness their capabilities.
