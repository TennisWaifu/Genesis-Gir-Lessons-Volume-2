Pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.

The playsound module must be imported to be used this module is responsible for playing audio files through the program
as you see through this .py file there are lots of playsound function calls being used these are responsible for outputting
the audio FX that you hear when you run the program or debug that's playsounds hefty work in cohesion with winsound
as well.

eg. import playsound, winsound

The playsound module contains only one thing - the function (also named) playsound.
It requires one argument - the path to the file with the sound you’d like to play. 
This may be a local file, or a URL.

There’s an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. 
Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously.

The winsound module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. It includes functions
and several constants.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙥(𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙮, 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣)

Beep the PC’s speaker. The frequency parameter specifies frequency, in hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767.
The duration parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last. If the system is not able to beep the speaker, RuntimeError is raised

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙎𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙(𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙, 𝙛𝙡𝙖𝙜𝙨)

Call the underlying PlaySound() function from the Platform API. The sound parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a bytes-like object,
or None. Its interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is None, 
any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙜𝙚𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙥(𝙩𝙮𝙥𝙚=𝙈𝘽_𝙊𝙆)

Call the underlying MessageBeep() function from the Platform API. This plays a sound as specified in the registry. The type argument specifies which sound to play; 
possible values are -1, MB_ICONASTERISK, MB_ICONEXCLAMATION, MB_ICONHAND, MB_ICONQUESTION, and MB_OK, all described below. The value -1 produces a “simple beep”; 
this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise. If the system indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙁𝙄𝙇𝙀𝙉𝘼𝙈𝙀

The sound parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with SND_ALIAS.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝘼𝙇𝙄𝘼𝙎

The sound parameter is a sound association name from the registry. If the registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless SND_NODEFAULT is also specified.
If no default sound is registered, raise RuntimeError. Do not use with SND_FILENAME.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙇𝙊𝙊𝙋
Play the sound repeatedly. The SND_ASYNC flag must also be used to avoid blocking. Cannot be used with SND_MEMORY.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙈𝙀𝙈𝙊𝙍𝙔
The sound parameter to PlaySound() is a memory image of a WAV file, as a bytes-like object.

𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙚: This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a combination of this flag and SND_ASYNC
will raise RuntimeError.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙋𝙐𝙍𝙂𝙀
Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.

𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚: This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝘼𝙎𝙔𝙉𝘾
Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝘿𝙀𝙁𝘼𝙐𝙇𝙏
If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝙎𝙏𝙊𝙋
Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝙒𝘼𝙄𝙏
Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.

𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚: This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝘼𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙍𝙄𝙎𝙆
Play the SystemDefault sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝙀𝙓𝘾𝙇𝘼𝙈𝘼𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉
Play the SystemExclamation sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝙃𝘼𝙉𝘿
Play the SystemHand sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝙌𝙐𝙀𝙎𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉
Play the SystemQuestion sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙊𝙆
Play the SystemDefault sound.
