The Last of Us takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a fungal-based, brain-altering pandemic has spread
and infected over 60 percent of the world's population. Since the outbreak, the world has gone into a state of panic and
frenzy as officials try to fix and keep the situation under control. When the World Health Organization's attempts to
procure a vaccine fail, the United States government does away with the bureaucrats in power and the establishment of
civilian government. The country is turned into a police state under the control of homeland security and the military, 
and cities across the nation are placed under martial law one by one. Survivors of the pandemic are assigned to designated
quarantine zones that are supposed to separate them from the infected and keep them safe.

Sometime within the twenty years leading up to the main events of the game, a paramilitary group calling themselves the 
Fireflies is established, with their main goal being the restoration of lawful government in the United States, as well as
finding and producing a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection. The Fireflies attack the military on occasion and encourage 
uprisings.

comments can be helpful for people reading your source code or for keeping notes for yourself! You can create a comment
with the hashtag symbol and anything after will be apart of that comment, keep mental reminders or leave notes for
a team working on the same code explain what a certain line of code is trying to do etc. comments will be a very powerful 
tool to use as a programmer and you can even comment out lines of code your having trouble with by putting a # in front
of that line of code to take it out of the program executions path and take it out when you fixed a problem in your project
this is called commenting out code! Give it a try

eg. # this is an example of a comment!

Pure Python, cross platform, single function module with no dependencies for playing sounds.

The playsound module must be imported to be used this module is responsible for playing audio files through the program
as you see through this .py file there are lots of playsound function calls being used these are responsible for outputting
the audio FX that you hear when you run the program or debug that's playsounds hefty work in cohesion with winsound
as well.

eg. import playsound, winsound

The playsound module contains only one thing - the function (also named) playsound.
It requires one argument - the path to the file with the sound you’d like to play. 
This may be a local file, or a URL.

There’s an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. 
Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously.

The winsound module provides access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. It includes functions
and several constants.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙥(𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙮, 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣)

Beep the PC’s speaker. The frequency parameter specifies frequency, in hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767.
The duration parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should last. If the system is not able to beep the speaker, RuntimeError is raised

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙎𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙(𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙, 𝙛𝙡𝙖𝙜𝙨)

Call the underlying PlaySound() function from the Platform API. The sound parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a bytes-like object,
or None. Its interpretation depends on the value of flags, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants described below. If the sound parameter is None, 
any currently playing waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙜𝙚𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙥(𝙩𝙮𝙥𝙚=𝙈𝘽_𝙊𝙆)

Call the underlying MessageBeep() function from the Platform API. This plays a sound as specified in the registry. The type argument specifies which sound to play; 
possible values are -1, MB_ICONASTERISK, MB_ICONEXCLAMATION, MB_ICONHAND, MB_ICONQUESTION, and MB_OK, all described below. The value -1 produces a “simple beep”; 
this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be played otherwise. If the system indicates an error, RuntimeError is raised.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙁𝙄𝙇𝙀𝙉𝘼𝙈𝙀

The sound parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with SND_ALIAS.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝘼𝙇𝙄𝘼𝙎

The sound parameter is a sound association name from the registry. If the registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless SND_NODEFAULT is also specified.
If no default sound is registered, raise RuntimeError. Do not use with SND_FILENAME.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙇𝙊𝙊𝙋
Play the sound repeatedly. The SND_ASYNC flag must also be used to avoid blocking. Cannot be used with SND_MEMORY.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙈𝙀𝙈𝙊𝙍𝙔
The sound parameter to PlaySound() is a memory image of a WAV file, as a bytes-like object.

𝙣𝙤𝙩𝙚: This module does not support playing from a memory image asynchronously, so a combination of this flag and SND_ASYNC
will raise RuntimeError.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙋𝙐𝙍𝙂𝙀
Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.

𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚: This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝘼𝙎𝙔𝙉𝘾
Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝘿𝙀𝙁𝘼𝙐𝙇𝙏
If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system default sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝙎𝙏𝙊𝙋
Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙎𝙉𝘿_𝙉𝙊𝙒𝘼𝙄𝙏
Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.

𝙉𝙤𝙩𝙚: This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝘼𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙍𝙄𝙎𝙆
Play the SystemDefault sound.

𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙.𝙈𝘽_𝙄𝘾𝙊𝙉𝙀𝙓𝘾𝙇𝘼𝙈𝘼𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉

While loop statements are loops that can re-iterate indefinitely until the condition is found false! Use while loops
for various tasks and can help when used with flow control statements!

eg. While True:
        print("Hello!")
        
eg. While True:
        break
        
eg. While True:
        continue

The following code in the example will print out the string literal forever, While we are stuck within this loop we are able to use
𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙠 statements to escape a while loops clause! Also you can use break & continue statements in for loops as well.

The round() function has its place in source code , by using it you can round off numbers with
its functionalities and make a float into an integer or round down or up but the funtion does this automatically!
Pretty amazing if i do say so myself!

ex. 5.78 is a floating point data type but if we use round() look what happens

ex. round(5.98) > 6 

ex. round(7.15) > 7

Its rounding off to the nearest integer making it easy to round numbers off it does two things at
once. converts the float into an integer and also makes it rounded off! Double the trouble sister!

The int() function is kinda similar to the round() function it converts any other data type to int!
can be used on floating point data types to convert them down to integers as well lets go give it a
whirl and see what it does.

ex. Here we have a float 5.55 and we want to convert it to integer

ex. int(5.55) > 5

as you see it converted pretty simple stuff  and this works like the round() as I said! so make sure
to test it out in your interactive shell and try out different lines of instruction to see what it does
and you learn things better when you do them than just reading also.
